        <div class="agile-content">
            <h3>Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools</h3>
            <p>
                We put people at the heart of the process—prioritizing collaboration across designers, developers, stakeholders, and users. By fostering open communication and continuous feedback loops, we ensured the redesigned system wasn’t just functional but truly user-centered. Usability testing, customer interviews, and regular stakeholder reviews became the backbone of our process, enabling us to iterate swiftly and keep the design aligned with user needs every step of the way.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation</h3>
            <p>
                Frequent and meaningful engagement with Turners’ stakeholders, customers, and internal teams was a game-changer. Instead of sticking rigidly to initial plans, we embraced the dynamic insights uncovered throughout the project. This close collaboration empowered us to adapt quickly, address real-world challenges, and create a seamless, intuitive buyer experience. By working hand-in-hand with customers and cross-functional teams, we ensured the solution not only met expectations but exceeded them.

  <h1 style="color: #0056b3;">Turners Cars Buying Insurance Usability Study</h1>
  <p>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of the redesigned 
      <span class="highlight">Turners Cars Insurance process and website</span>,
      focusing on enabling a seamless user experience for purchasing and managing car insurance. The study aimed to assess the design solutions against Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, ensuring the process met user needs related to navigation, policy comparison, and information accessibility.
  </p>

  <h2  style="color: #0056b3;">Methodologies for testing</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">Heuristic Evaluation:</span> Identified potential usability issues through a heuristic evaluation workshop, leveraging Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics as a framework.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Moderated Usability Testing:</span> Conducted task-based testing to evaluate the effectiveness of design solutions. Participants were asked to perform key tasks such as purchasing insurance, comparing policies, and navigating the website.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Participants:</span> A mix of tech-savvy users, cost-conscious individuals, and customers familiar with online insurance processes.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Metrics Tracked:</span> Task completion rate, error rate, task completion time, and satisfaction score (Likert scale).</p>

 

  <h2  style="color: #0056b3;">Key Findings in testing</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">Overall Usability Satisfaction:</span> Users rated the overall usability positively, with scores between 4 and 5 on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants appreciated the streamlined process and the clarity of the policy comparison tool.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Common Suggestions:</span></p>
  <ul>
      <li>Improve clarity of policy coverage descriptions by simplifying language and providing more examples.</li>
      <li>Simplify navigation by reducing redundant menu options and enhancing the visibility of primary actions.</li>
      <li>Add progress indicators during multi-step processes such as purchasing or updating a policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2  style="color: #0056b3;">Conclusions for testing</h2>
  <p>
    The redesigned Turners Cars Insurance process and website performed well against Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. Strengths included effective system status visibility, error prevention, and user control. However, some opportunities for improvement were identified in areas such as clarity of information and user navigation
  </p>

  <h2  style="color: #0056b3;">Recommendations for Next Steps to develop High Fidelity Wireframe</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Refine Policy Information Layout: Use visual aids like icons and tooltips to enhance understanding of coverage options.</li>
      <li>Enhance Comparisons:Improve the comparison tool with side-by-side visuals and customizable filters.</li>
      <li>Simplify Navigation:Consolidate redundant menu items and prioritize key user actions like "Get a Quote" and "File a Claim."</li>
